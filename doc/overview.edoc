@doc This is rather experimental Erlang application introducing Clojure-style agent in Erlang.

The Clojure-like agents are simple processes/threads that holds it's state. They handles no messages like Erlang 
processes. The following is a list of things you may want to do with such agents:

<ul>
        <li>You may make them to evaluate a function against it's state. Let's call this 
            <em>{@link agent:send/2. sending}</em> a function to
            the agent so that the agent can evaluate it within it's own process:

            <pre>
            %% let's say `Agt' is an agent reference. It's state value
            %% is an integer. You want to increase it.

            agent:send(Agt, fun (A, V) -> {ok, V+1} end).
            </pre>
            </li>

        <li>You may evaluate a function against an agent state in separate, short-run process. Let's call this <em>sending</em> a function 
            <em>{@link agent:send_off/2. off}</em> the agent:

            <pre>
            agent:send_off(Agt, fun (A, V) -> {ok, V+1} end).
            </pre>
            The new state would be "sent" back to the agent (using common Erlang message). By default, a versioning control is used.
            If the updated agent's state value is older than the current value the function evaluation is respawned again.</li>

        <li>You may ask an agent for it's state value. This is different than Clojure implementation since Clojure's agents
            state is directly accessed:

            <pre>
            StateValue = agent:state(Agt).
            </pre></li>

        <li>You may start watching how the agent's state value is changing:

            <pre>
            Watcher = fun (A, OldValue, NewValue) ->
                        io:format("Agent ~p changed it's value from ~p to ~p~n", [A, OldValue, NewValue])
                      end,
            agent:add_watch(Agent, Watcher)
            </pre>
            Now, if you send a function to the agent `Agent' the `Watcher' will be evaluated after the agent state value 
            has been changed and you may expect a nice info on your display. The watching function <strong>is not</strong>
            evaluated when the state value has not changed.</li>
</ul>

=== Implementation details ===

There are two implementations of the agent process:
<ul>
<li> OTP-compatible which uses `gen_server' ({@link agent_srv. agent_srv} module)</li>
<li> "raw" using simple loop-based process ({@link agent_proc. agent_proc} module)</li>
</ul>
The first type of agent is started with {@link agent:start/1. agent:start/1} and {@link agent:start/3. agent:start/3} function,
the latter with {@link agent:start_link/1. agent:start_link/1} and {@link agent:start_link/3. agent:start_link/3}.

{@link agent:send/2. agent:send/2} function uses Erlang message passing to transport given function to an agent. As it's been mentioned before,
{@link agent:send_off/2. agent:send_off/2,3} makes an agent process to create a separate process and send to it message containing funcion to be evaluated with the agent
reference and the state value. The versioned {@link agent:send_off/3. agent:send_off(Agent, Fun [, true])} may ends up in several respawning separate evaluation process
(possibly infinite number of times ;)) if there's a version conflict on update.

The "watchers" are implemented as separate long-run processes (non-OTP compatible, unsupervised) being monitored by an agent and monitoring the agent process. No ETS tables or such
are used to keep the list of living "watchers". The implementation uses [http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/erlang.html#process_info-2 erlang:process_info(Pid, monitors)] to
obtain the set of living "watchers".
 
=== Agent's functions ===

The functions sent to/off an agent accepts two arguments. First is the agent reference, the second is it's state value.
It should return a tuple containing two or three element:
<ul>
<li> `{ok, NewValue::any()}' to make the agent change it's state value to `NewValue', or</li>
<li> `{ok, NewValue::any(), Timeout::timeout()}' to make the agent change it's state value to `NewValue' <strong>and</strong>
     fire an internal timer which after `Timeout' milliseconds send `timeout' message to the agent, which in turn will evaluate
     "timeout" function. The "timeout" function signature is the same as ordinary agent function. </li>
</ul>
All new state values are validated with "validation" function, which accepts new state value and return boolean, like this:
<pre>
   fun (NewStateValue) -> 
     NewStateValue =/= 0
   end
</pre>
Both functions, "timeout" and "validation", may be set or get with {@link agent:set/3. agent:set/3} and 
{@link agent:get/2. agent:get/2} functions.

=== Toys ===

There is one toy in this package (not counting this application as a joke). This is {@link agent_ref. agent_ref} module, which is
an abstract (parameterized) module just because I can. It allows to use `Agent:send(...)' notation. I saves typing. I cannot see other
reasons to use this module. You may start tinkering with this typing:
<pre>
Agent = agent:start_ref(0),
Agent:send(fun (_, V) -> {ok, V+1} end).
</pre>
(the OTP equivalent is {@link agent:start_link_ref/1. agent:start_link_ref/1,3}) and three-argument versions.
